This is a repo for Darach to track and host containers for doing 
bioinf/research.

- The main intention is to run as Singularity containers on linux systems,
    but they're written as Docker for compatibility (thanks Mohammed Kahlfan
    for the tip).
- There's a hope that this can get built and hosted on GitHub

Organzation copied from [jlboat](https://github.com/jlboat/BioinfoContainers).
(Of course, makes total sense to just use tags to organize things!)

Some recipes are for individual tools, some are for workflows and so are
combos. Trying to figure out the ontology of this.

Todo:

- Docker containers for:
    - seq qc
    - munging and sed/awk-fu and shell
    - starcode and requisite munging
    - bartender I guess
    - r
    - jupyter
    - python3
    - lh3
    - pacbio
    - nanopore
    - alignparse
